# Incrementing Counter

This is a simple web application that allows users to track the number of followers on three different social media platforms. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use the application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The page will load and display the follower counts for each social media platform, which will be set to zero by default.

To increment the follower count, simply click on the respective social media button. Each click will increase the count by one.
